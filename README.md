# Knightferret Unity Utils

These are just some simple utilities and noise generators I use 
with Unity 3D projects.  The internal documentation is sparce and 
alternates between proper C# and Javadoc since many of these were 
prototyped in Java and ported to C# for use with Unity.

These may not be widely useful to everyone, as some of this relates 
to niche uses such as use in advanced procedural content generation, 
among other things.
